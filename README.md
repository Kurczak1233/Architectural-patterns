# Architectural-patterns
Backend/Fronted architectural patterns


Basically this repo is for learning more architectural patterns.

Basically the first one is the microservice pattern. It's not a hard task to find a ready made template but there are not many simple templates or the architecture used
there may be just overcomplicated. For this reason I've decided to create a simple, pattern for my future projects or just for fun.

Basically what I'm trying to achieve.
